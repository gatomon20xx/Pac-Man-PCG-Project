Push/Pull Standard
==================
 - ALWAYS PULL before pushing (esp to main and dev)
 - test your branch for web deployment before merging with dev/main etc.


Branching Strategy: simplified gitflow
======================================
Server Branches
---------------
main: protected. Only STABLE verions
 -- tag releases from main
dev: semi-protected. used to merge team's work



Local Branches - for lone devs
------------------------------
 <local branches>: use to develop and hot fix locally



Commit Messages
===============
Each commit message should contain:
 1. [#<github issue number>] (if applicable). You can look up the github issue number here: https://github.com/qed-lab/ProjectCODE/projects
 2. [<short general description of what changes apply to>]
 3. a short (but complete) list of changes for the commit with more detail
 
TEMPLATES:
 -- Short commit message (Quick fix, simple changes, etc.)
	[#<github issue number>] [what was updated] how it was changed/updated

 -- Long commit message (e.g. complicated fix, lots of changes, new additions)
	[#<github issue number>] [1. what was updated] 
	 - how it was changed/updated
	
	[#<github issue number>] [2. what was updated] 
	 - how it was changed/updated
	 - another way it was updated
